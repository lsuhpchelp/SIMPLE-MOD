## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 About SIMPLE-MOD

**SIMPLE-MOD** (**S**ingularity **I**ntegrated **M**odule-key **P**roducer for **L**oadable **E**nvironment **MOD**ules) is a QT-based GUI tool to automatically generate module keys for easy access of container-based software packages.

Currently, SIMPLE-MOD supports two commonly used module systems through pre-written templates: 
- ***Environment Modules*** (https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules) 
- ***Lmod*** (https://github.com/TACC/Lmod)

Other support can be added by adding customized templates.

### 1.2 Who is SIMPLE-MOD for

SIMPLE-MOD is designed for HPC administrators who oversee software installation and deployment. Its purpose is to help administrators conveniently create module keys from software in Singularity/Apptainer container images, taking advantage of the installation-free portability. If your HPC systems use a module system (***Environment Modules*** or ***Lmod***) and Singularity/Apptainer, this may be your simple solution to deploy container-based software. This allows users to activate software with a simple ```module load``` command and use the executables as if they were installed natively, without needing to know they are using containers.

SIMPLE-MOD is most suitable for software accessible via a handful of executables. However, it is not suitable for all software or use cases. For example, it is not suitable for pure libraries, and may be not suitable for software that would be used as dependencies. It is at the administrators' discretion to determine which software packages can be deployed with SIMPLE-MOD. Administrators are also responsible for testing the deployed module keys on the clusters. The databases and templates provided with the code are for reference only, and the LSU HPC group shall not be held responsible for the installation, deployment, testing, and validation of the software.

SIMPLE-MOD is primarily designed for HPC administrators; however, interested users can also use it to generate customized module keys. Knowledge and permissions to set up customized module keys are required.


## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Running with Python

As a QT-based Python program, SIMPLE-MOD is installation-free. To run SIMPLE-MOD, simply run it with Python:

```
python simple-mod.py
```

It is tested with Python 3 and PyQt5 module as dependency. If PyQt5 is not installed on your system, please install it with pip:

```
pip install pyqt5
```

### 2.2 Running in a Singularity image

If for any reason you cannot run it with Python on your system (e.g., lack of dependencies and you do not have the permission to install), you may also build a SIMPLE-MOD container image and run it with Singularity/Apptainer. The recipe is provided in `singularity.def`. To build it with Singularity/Appatainer, please run the below command in terminal:

```
singularity build simple-mod.sif recipe.def
```

Once the image is build, you may run it with:

```
singularity run simple-mod.sif
```
